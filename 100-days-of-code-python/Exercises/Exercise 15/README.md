# Coffee Machine Project

**task: Create a coffee machine**

## Programming Fundamentals Used:

- functions, Conditionals, Loops, User Input
- arithmetic Operations
- Error Handling (try-except)

## What I Learned / Thoughts about exercise:
The exercise was to create / simulate a coffee machine based on a list of requirements. Completed the exercise
while putting all the different steps of the machine is their own separate functions. Also added comments where
needed to make reading the code easier for others. 

Did not learn many new things but was a great exercise to practice writing clean code. The one thing I did learn
was that calculations using decimals are not 100% accurate and require some steps to make sure your number has
a max of 2 decimals, I achieved this using the abs function.
