# Caesar cipher

**task: Create a program than can encrypt and decrypt using the caesar cipher method**

## Programming Fundamentals Used:

- Data Structures
- functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- User Input
- Arithmetic/wrapping by using the % operator for wrapping around the alphabet
- Error handling

## What I Learned / Thoughts about exercise:
Learned about Caesar Cipher but also about a way of using the % operator 
that I never thought about. This also caused me to look deeper into the 
modulo operator in general creating a deeper understanding.

Exercise was a very fun introduction to basic encrypting and decrypting.
