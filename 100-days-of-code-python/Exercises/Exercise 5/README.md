# Password Generator

**task: Create a basic password generator**

## Programming Fundamentals Used:

- user input
- lists
- choices method from the random module
- shuffle method from the random module
- for loops

## What I Learned / Thoughts about exercise:

I knew some of the methods from the random module but hadn't really used 
choices before or shuffle before, didn't really realise how handy these 
tools could be for doing basic tasks without having to hard code it.
