# Number Guessing Project

**task: Create a Number Guessing game**

## Programming Fundamentals Used:

- functions, Conditionals, Loops, User Input
- arithmetic Operations
- unicode characters
- Error Handling (try-except)

## What I Learned / Thoughts about exercise:
The exercise was without any hints or examples, and we only had a demo of the existing 
game. This was an interesting way of recreating something you have seen, this made me 
think about what was happening in the demo and how I could achieve the same.

Got a better understanding in which cases you can use the try-expect and why it can be 
useful to use this type of error handling to catch undesired user input. without the
game suddenly crashing or stopping.

Also made sure that I split up sections where I deemed it useful in order to have a 
more structured layout of the code and making it easier to make adjustments later if 
needed. This also helps me to make sure I start dividing the different action into 
functions in the future to keep my programming style more professional.
