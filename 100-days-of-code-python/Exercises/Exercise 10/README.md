# Calculator project

**task: Create a text based calculator**

## Programming Fundamentals Used:

- functions (split tasks into different function)
- Conditionals
- Dictionaries
- Loops
- User Input
- arithmetic Operations

## What I Learned / Thoughts about exercise:
Decided that I wanted to divide as many small tasks as I could into different
functions. This makes it easier for other people to read the code. Wanted to
make sure I keep implementing this style of programming where most if not
all functions have 1 purpose only. This should make It easier to apply chances later
without breaking massive parts of the code.
